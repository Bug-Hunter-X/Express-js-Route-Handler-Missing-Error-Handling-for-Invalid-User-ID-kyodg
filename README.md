# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where `:id` is not a valid number, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed route handler.  It attempts to find a user based on the provided ID, but doesn't check if the ID is a number or if a user with that ID exists.  This can result in errors if a non-numeric ID is passed or if the ID doesn't correspond to an existing user.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler.  It includes checks to ensure the ID is a valid number and that a user with that ID exists. If either condition is not met, appropriate error responses (400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found) are returned.
